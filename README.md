grails-postgresql-partition-prototype
=====================================

A small prototype demonstrating partitioning of a Postgresql table with a grails integration test.

You will need to create a local database called "partition_test" (or update DataSources.groovy appropriately).  Then just run the tests (there is only one): grails test-app
